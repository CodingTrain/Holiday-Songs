Dashing through the code
[C]                 [F]
In the Processing IDE
[F]                  [G7]
Through the lines we go
[G7]                [C]
Refactoring all the way.

[C]
Code is way too long
[C]              [F]
Making functions tight
[F]               [G7]
What fun it is to make long code
[G7]            [C]       [G7]
A handful lines tonight - oh!

[C]
Refactoring, refactoring,
[C]
Refactoring all the way,
[F]            [C]   [D]
Oh what fun it is to use
          [G]         [G7]
For-loops everywhere, ay,

[C]
Refactoring, refactoring,
[C]
Refactoring all the way,
[F]           [C]   [D]
Code is oh so short now,
     [G7]           [C]
With iterations and arrays
```
