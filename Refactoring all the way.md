# Refactoring all the way

Dashing through the code
In the Processing IDE
Through the lines we go
Refactoring all the way.

Code is way too long
Making functions tight
What fun it is to make long code
A handful lines tonight.

Refactoring, refactoring,
Refactoring all the way,
Oh what fun it is to use
For-loops everywhere, ay,

Refactoring, refactoring,
Refactoring all the way,
Code is oh so short now,
With iterations and arrays
```
