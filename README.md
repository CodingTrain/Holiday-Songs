### Coding Train

_(to the tune of Jingle Bells)_

```
Declaring global variables
above the function setup.
Filling the array of bubbles
[NEED A GOOD RHYME HERE?]

Coding Train Coding Train
Coding iteration
Oh what fun it is to type
A flocking simulation, hey

Coding Train Coding Train
Coding p5 js
Oh what fun it is to type
And see the 60 FPS, hey
```
