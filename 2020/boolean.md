# All I Want For Christmas is Boolean (to the tune of “All I Want For Christmas is You”)

```
I don’t want a lot for Christmas
One of two things is all I need
It could be true or false, babe
0s and 1s are  all I see
I just want to always know
My only choice is yes or no
Limit options to two
All I want for Christmas is bool….boolean, baby
```
