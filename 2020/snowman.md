# Do You Want to Code a Snowman?

```
Do you wanna code a snowman?
We can color with RGB
We can code a stack of circles, and a triangle for a nose that’s pretty sweet
You’ve just gotta use ellipse(), strokeWeight(), background(), then add in a fill() that’s white
Do you wanna code a snowman?
It doesn’t have to be a snowman.
(Go away, Daniel)
Okay, bye...
