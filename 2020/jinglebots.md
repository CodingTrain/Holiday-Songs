# Jingle Bots (to the tune of “Jingle Bells”)

```
Jingle bots, jingle bots
Automate away
Oh, what fun it is to code them 
Each and every day (hey!)
Jingle bots, jingle bots
They’re my only friends
When I’m chatting with my bots
The fun just never ends

Toying with their code
Seeing what they have to say
You just never know
How they’ll mess up today (ha ha ha)
Feeding them info
Reducing delay
When I’m hanging with the bots 
My problems go away , ohhh

Jingle bots, jingle bots
Automate away
Oh, what fun it is to program
Each and every day (hey!)
Jingle bots, jingle bots
They’re my only friends
When I’m chatting with my bots
The fun just never ends
```
