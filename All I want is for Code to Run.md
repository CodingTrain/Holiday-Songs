# All I want is for Code to Run
*(to the tune of All I want for Christmas is You)*
```
I dont need a lot for coding
There is just one thing I need
ints & double can keep floating
Underneath binary trees
I just want the code to work
just waiting for you to be done
make my code, error free
all I want is for code to run

I dont need a lot for coding
There is just one thing I need, and I
Don't care about these pixels
Underneath the computer screen
dont need to know my setLocation()
or rather the printProjection()
Algorithms, won't make me happy
With a high complexity

I just want you to compile
just like saving a file
Make my wish come true
fill() or nofill(), you can choose

I wont ask alot for coding
I wont even Switch for cases, I
I just wanna keep these Functions
testing for the malfunctions

won't make lists, maybe arrays
From the Setup() to the Draw()
There is no time for Delay()
To hear the sounds of mousePressed() click

I just want the code to run right
even till the smallest bytes
What more can be done
IDE, all I want is for code to run

All the loops are running
So evidently, here
Sound Of CreateAudio()
adds extra joy to ears

and every object is new
adding different types of hue()
decided on either blue()
or what I need is green()
Refactoring the code, might make this quickly

I dont need a lot for coding
This is all I'm switching for
I just wanna see this sketch
outside this loop, I'm writing for

I just want this to run
I just want to see my code
from ide to let it roam
all I want is for code to run
```
