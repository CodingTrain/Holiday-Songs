[G]
[G]
I don't want this dot for Christmas.
[G]
There is just one var I need.
[C]
I don't care about the syntax.
[C]
Or the wasted memory.

[G]            [G]       [B7]
I just want my sketch to play
[Em]                [Em] [Cm]
more than you could ever say.
[G]            [E7]
Let's try Java mode. 
[Am]           [D]          [G]
All I want for Christmas is code.

[G]
I don't want this dot for Christmas.
[G]
There is just one boolean I need.
[C]
I'm just gonna keep on looping
[C]
Until I run out of memory.

[B7]
I won't make a linked list and send it
[Em]
Without the use of websockets.

[B7]
I won't even stay awake to
[Em]
try debugging with an IDE.

[Cm]
I just want my code to sing
[G]                   [E7]
More than you want machine learning.

[G]            [E7]
Maybe it'll work with Node?
[Am]           [D]          [G]
All I want for Christmas is code.
