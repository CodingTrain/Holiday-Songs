# The Twelve Days of Coding
*(to the tune of The Twelve Days of Christmas)*
```
On the # day of coding p5 gave to me
12 Neural networks
11 index errors
10 People posing
9 for loops looping
8 fractals forming
7 sorters sorting
6 cameras switching
5 quick draw rings
4 derping boids
3 this dots
2 pull requests
And a null pointing binary tree


Alternate lyrics. (Incomplete) 


And a CodingTrain live stream
2 this dots 
3 perfect loops
4 flocking boids
FIVE stolen memes

10 loops a looping 
11 Pixels Updating 
12 Sketches Running
