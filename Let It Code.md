# Let It Code
*(to the tune of let it snow)*
```
       C         G7      C
oh the ide whitespace is sightful
       C         D7      G7
but this while loop is so insightful
Dm         A7      Dm
p5 or java is the mode
G7                        C
Let us Code, Let us Code, Let Us Code

C                       G7       C
frameRate() doesnt show signs of dropping
C             D7            G7
rectMode(CENTER), so no signs of cropping
Dm         A7      Dm
add text() for the letters to show
G7                        C
Let us Code, Let us Code, Let Us Code

        G                G
When we finally add some lights()
Am         D7      G
not a fan of using static()
        G                G
change the y value for some height
A7           D7
then proceeding to createGraphics()

       C         G7      C
the keypress() is slowly typing
       C         D7      G7
as the mouseX() is quickly rising
Dm         A7      Dm
as smoothly as the shapeMode()
G7                        C
Let us Code, Let us Code, Let Us Code

C                       G7       C
frameRate() doesnt show signs of dropping
C             D7            G7
rectMode(CENTER), so no signs of cropping
Dm         A7      Dm
add text() for the letters to show
G7                        C
Let us Code, Let us Code, Let Us Code

Oh let us Code
All the for loops will keep looping
All the for loops will keep me warm
the keypress() is slowly typing

as the mouseX() is quickly rising
as smoothly as the shapeMode()
Let us Code, Let us Code, Let Us Code
Let us Code, Let us Code, Let Us Code

Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
```
