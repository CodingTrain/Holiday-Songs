# Let It Code
*(to the tune of let it snow)*
```
oh the ide whitespace is sightful
but this while loop is so insightful
p5 or java is the mode
Let us Code, Let us Code, Let Us Code

framerate() doesnt show signs of dropping
rectmode(), so no signs of cropping
add text() for the letters to show
Let us Code, Let us Code, Let Us Code

When we finally add some lights()
not a fan of using static()
change the y value for some height()
then proceeding to createGraphic()

the keypress() is slowly typing
as the mouseX() is quickly rising
as smoothly as the shapeMode()
Let us Code, Let us Code, Let Us Code

framerate() doesnt show signs of dropping
rectmode(), so no signs of cropping
add text for the letters to show
Let us Code, Let us Code, Let Us Code

Oh let us Code
All the for loops will keep looping
All the for loops will keep me warm
the keypress() is slowly typing

as the mouseX() is quickly rising
as smoothly as the shapeMode()
Let us Code, Let us Code, Let Us Code
Let us Code, Let us Code, Let Us Code

Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
```
